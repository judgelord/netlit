Understanding the gaps and connections across existing theories and findings is a perennial challenge in scientific research. Systematically reviewing scholarship is especially challenging for researchers who may lack domain expertise, including junior scholars or those exploring new substantive territory. Conversely, senior scholars may rely on longstanding assumptions and social networks that exclude new research. In both cases, ad hoc literature reviews hinder accumulation of knowledge. Scholars are rarely systematic in selecting relevant prior work or then identifying patterns across their sample. To encourage systematic, replicable, and transparent methods for assessing literature, we propose an accessible network-based framework for reviewing scholarship. In our method, we consider a literature as a network of recurring concepts (nodes) and theorized relationships among them (edges). 
Network statistics and visualization allow researchers to see patterns and offer reproducible characterizations of assertions about the major themes in existing literature. 

`netlit` provides functions to generate network statistics from a literature review. Specifically, it processes a dataset where each row is a proposed relationship ("edge") between two concepts or variables ("nodes").
The aim is to offer easy tools to begin using the power of network analysis in R for literature reviews. Using `netlit` simply requires researchers to enter relationships they observe in prior studies into a simple spreadsheet.


# Using the `netlit` R Package 


The `netlit`  package provides functions to generate network statistics from a literature review. Specifically, `netlit` provides a wrapper for `igraph` functions to facilitate using network analysis in literature reviews. 


Install this package with 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("judgelord/netlit")
```

To install `netlit` from CRAN, run the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("netlit")
```

## Basic Usage

The `review()` function takes in a dataframe, `data`, that includes `from` and `to` columns (a directed graph structure). 

In the example below, we use example data from [this project on redistricting](https://github.com/judgelord/redistricting). These data are a set of related concepts (`from` and `to`) in the redistricting literature and citations for these relationships (`cites` and `cites_empirical`). See `vignette("netlit")` for more details on this example.

```{r literature}
library(netlit)

# Load replication version of main data and metadata on citations
load("replication_data/literature.rda")

literature %>% kable()
```

---

`netlit` offers four main functions: `make_edgelist()`, `make_nodelist()`, `augment_nodelist()`, and `review()`. 

`review()` is the primary function. The others are helper functions that perform the individual steps that `review()` does all at once. `review()` takes in a dataframe with at least two columns representing linked concepts (e.g., a cause and an effect) and returns data augmented with network statistics. Users must either specify "from" nodes and "to" nodes with the `from` and `to` arguments or include columns named `from` and `to` in the supplied `data` object.

`review()` returns a list of three objects: 

1. an augmented `edgelist` (a list of relationships with `edge_betweenness` calculated), 
2. an augmented `nodelist` (a list of concepts with `degree` and `betweenness` calculated), and 
3. a `graph` object suitable for use in other `igraph` functions or other network visualization packages. 

Users may wish to include edge attributes (e.g., information about the relationship between the two concepts) or node attributes (information about each concept). We show how to do so below. But first, consider the basic use of `review()`: 


```{r}
lit <- review(literature, from = "from", to = "to")

lit

edges <- lit$edgelist

edges %>%  kable()

nodes <- lit$nodelist

nodes %>%  kable()
```

Edge and node attributes can be added using the `edge_attributes` and `node_attributes` arguments. `edge_attributes` is a vector that identifies columns in the supplied data frame that the user would like to retain. `node_attributes` is a separate dataframe that contains attributes for each node in the primary data set. The example `node_attributes` data include one column `type` indicating a type for each each node/variable/concept. 

```{r}
# Load replication version of node type coding
load("replication_data/node_attributes.rda")

node_attributes %>% kable()

lit <- review(literature,
              edge_attributes = c("cites", "cites_empirical"),
              node_attributes = node_attributes)

lit
```

Tip: to retain all variables from `literature`, use `edge_attributes = names(literature)`.


## More Advanced Uses: larger networks, visualizing your network, network descriptives

<!-- Additional columns in the redistricting literature data include discriptions of the `edge` (the relationship between the `to` and `from` concepts), the theorized `mechanism`, and `cite_weight`---the number of studies in the literature that cite that that causal relationship.  

### A Larger Edgelist and Nodelist --> 

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(ggraph)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
clean <- . %>% 
  str_replace_all("([a-z| |-]{8}) ","\\1\n") %>%
  str_replace_all(" ([a-z| |-]{9})",  "\n\\1") %>% str_to_title() %>% 
  str_replace("\nOf\n", "\nOf ") %>% 
  str_replace("\nFellow ", " Fellow\n") %>% 
  str_replace("\nState\n", " State\n") %>% 
  str_replace("\nDistrict\n", " District\n") %>% 
  str_replace("\nWith\n", " With\n")

literature$from %<>% clean() 
literature$to %<>% clean()
node_attributes$node %<>% clean() 
```

We separated multiple cites to a theorized relationship with semicolons. 
Let's count the total number of citations and the number of citations to empirical work by splitting out each cite and measuring the length of that vector. 

```{r}
# count cites 
literature %<>% 
  group_by(to, from) %>% 
  mutate(cite_weight = str_split(cites, ";")[[1]]  %>% length(),
         cite_weight_empirical = str_split(cites_empirical, ";",)[[1]] %>% length(),
         cite_weight_empirical = ifelse(is.na(cites_empirical), 0, cite_weight_empirical)) %>% 
  ungroup() 

# subsets 
literature %<>% mutate(communities_node = str_c(to, from) %>% str_detect("Commun"),
                       confound = case_when(
      from == "Preserve\nCommunities\nOf Interest" & to == "Rolloff" ~ T,
      from == "Voter\nInformation\nAbout Their\nDistrict" & to == "Rolloff" ~ T,
      from == "Preserve\nCommunities\nOf Interest" 
            & to == "Voter\nInformation\nAbout Their\nDistrict" ~ T,
      T ~ F),
              empirical = ifelse(!is.na(cites_empirical),
                                 "Empirical work", 
                                 "No empirical work"))
```

Now we use `review()` on this expanded edgelist, including all variables in the `literature` data with `edge_attributes = names(literature)`.

```{r}
# now with all node and edge attributes 
lit <- review(literature,
              edge_attributes = names(literature),
              node_attributes = node_attributes
              )

edges <- lit$edgelist

edges %>% kable()

nodes <- lit$nodelist

nodes %>%  kable()
```

### The `igraph` object

```{r}
# define igraph object as g
g <- lit$graph

g
```

What does it mean?

- `D` means directed  
- `N` means named graph  
- `W` means weighted graph  
- `name (v/c)` means _name_ is a node attribute and it's a character  
- `cite_weight (e/n)` means _cite_weight_ is an edge attribute and it's numeric

## With `ggraph`

We can also plot using the package `ggraph` package to plot the `igraph` object.

This package allows us to plot self-ties, but it is slightly more difficult to use ggplot features (e.g. colors and legend labels) compared to `ggnetwork`.

```{r ggraph, cache= FALSE}
set.seed(5)
library(ggraph)

p <- ggraph(g, layout = 'fr') + 
  geom_node_point(
    aes(color = degree_total %>% as.factor() ),
    size = 6, 
    alpha = .7
    ) + 
  geom_edge_arc2(
    start_cap = circle(3,'mm'),
    end_cap = circle(6, 'mm'),
    aes(
      color = cite_weight ,
      linetype = empirical
      ),
    curvature = 0,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, 'mm'), 
                  type = "open")
    ) +
  geom_edge_loop(
      start_cap = circle(5, 'mm'),
      end_cap = circle(2, 'mm'),
      aes( color = cite_weight ,
           linetype = empirical
      ),
      n = 300,
      strength = .6,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, 'mm'), 
                  type = "open")
    ) +
  geom_node_text( aes(label = name), size = 2.3) +

       color = "Total Degree\nCentrality",
       edge_linetype = "") +

                        discrete = FALSE,
                        option = "plasma",
                        begin = 0,
                        end = .9,
                        direction = -1,
                        guide = "legend",
                        aesthetics = "edge_colour") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "mako", 
                        begin = 1, 
                        end = .5)

# About the example data

Articles were chosen according to specific selection criteria. We first identified articles published since 2010 that either 1) were published in one of eight high-ranking journals or 2) gained at least 50 citations according to Google Scholar. We then chose articles that contained four possible key terms in the title or abstract.

```{r}
# Journal articles in example data
data("literature_metadata")

literature_metadata %>% kable()

# count publications per journal
pub_table <- literature_metadata %>% 
  filter(str_detect(paste(literature$cites, collapse = "|"), Author)) %>% 
  count(Publication, name = "Articles") %>%
  mutate(Publication = case_when(
    Publication == "AJPS" ~ "American Journal of Political Science",
    Publication == "APSR" ~ "American Political Science Review",
    Publication == "BJPS" ~ "British Journal of Political Science",
    Publication == "JOP" ~ "The Journal of Politics",
    Publication == "NCL Review" ~ "North Carolina Law Review",
    Publication == "QJPS" ~ "Quarterly Journal of Political Science",
    TRUE ~ Publication
  )) 

pub_table %>% kable()
